        <a name="what-is-cp"></a>
        <h3>What is Camper+?</h3>
        <p>
          Camper+ is the prefect toolbox for camp administrators to set up their camp. Camper+ aims to organize all the requirements an administrator would have to do; from registration to creating nametags. Most camps would have to use multiple external sources to gather their information, but with Camper+, everything would be consolidated into one site.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I register as a Administrator?</h3>

          Administrators will have to email us at Register@camperplus.herukuapp.com to obtain a unique username and password to access their server.

        <a name="assign-groups"></a>
        <h3>How do I assign campers into groups?</h3>

          After campers are sorted into groups, you can either click on the (+) symbol on the bottom of the page and create a time slot for each group. You can also highlight the times slots and fill out the form.

        <a name="nametag"></a>
        <h3>How does the nametag generator work?</h3>
        <p>
          You would create a template for one nametag and it would print a pdf of nametags for all your campers. 
        </p>
